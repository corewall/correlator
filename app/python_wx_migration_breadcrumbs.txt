Breadcrumbs on upgrading Correlator from Python 2 to 3 and wxPython 2.9 to 4+ ("Phoenix")

### wxPython ###

TreeListCtrl is really HyperTreeList in disguise. Can no longer use the "IsOk()" method.
Instead, if a TreeListItem returned from e.g. tree.GetFirstChild() is not None, it's valid.
Otherwise it's not. Need to replace all IsOk() calls.

Getting back into this and trying to remember what the heck I was doing.
The old VE seems to be broken...I still don't understand why this happens, but pip
is unavailable. Created a new VE that's now Python 3.10 (old one was 3.9). This
resulted in some new issues related to int vs float in DC.DrawText() etc. 

https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2038

Unfortunately it seems that DrawText() itself (and other DrawContext methods) didn't get fixed,
so we'll have to convert to int manually. Hopefully a million other f'ns won't need the same treatment
but I have a bad feeling they will.
